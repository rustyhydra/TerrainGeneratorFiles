this program will generate an array of points that can be passed to a script to become an STL.

functioning details, this program creats an array of cordinate point obgects that are then filled in by
creating 180 points in a half cirlce each point is on a different ring, then it does this 360 times changing
what the degree that it makes the point on is by 1 each time to make a sphere. to avoid making a perfect
sphere (boring) when it is filling in the points the program will randomly adjust the distance from the 
center of the sphere then use 3d trig to convert that distance into cartisian cordinates.
