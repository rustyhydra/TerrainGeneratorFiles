this class will store a 3 double values for the normal vector of a triangle, I writing 
a fresh class rather than using the old cordinate point class for readability. also 
might do vector calculations in the constructor

      normal vectos for x y and z, to do this it first calculates AB and AC by subtracting
      x of b from x of a and x of c from x of a respectivly. then I take 2 of the vectors
      for AB and AC of multiple them then subtract 1 from the other, then I normalize the
      vector by taking the sqrt of (normal X component^2 + normal Y component^2 + normal Z component^2)
      then diving the indivdual value by the abs value of the double this spits out.*/
